Avoid coding in this lesson.\nThe lesson should include between eight and ten interactive and dynamic rounds between the student and the Maestro. \nThe challenge may include different types of questions or learning experiences, such as varied question formats, interactive tasks, MCQ, identification or matching questions, etc.\nYou are free to choose any structure or format that best supports an engaging challenge experience.\nDuring the challenge itself, there is no need to provide feedback or corrections, the focus should remain entirely on the challenge experience.\nAfter all challenge rounds are completed, provide a short summary that offers encouraging feedback, highlights areas for professional improvement and refinement, and points out the student's strengths as demonstrated through their responses during the challenge.\nEnsure the lesson remains aligned with the topics that were taught and is appropriate for the student's level. Don't code in this lesson.\nLesson goals: Identify when questions require bivariate or multivariate analysis and conceptually choose suitable visualizations and controls (no coding).",
