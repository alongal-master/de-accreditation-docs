[2026-01-11 18:38:01] LESSON PARSING (STREAMED)
------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT:

Parse the following course content and extract unit headers, lesson titles, and learning outcomes.
Lesson names are followed by learning outcome for each lesson. All learning outcomes lines start with "--- ".
Unit headers appear as section titles (e.g., "## Unit Name", "Unit 1: Name", or standalone headers before groups of lessons).

Return the result in this exact format:

UNIT: [Unit Name]
TITLE: [Lesson Title]
OUTCOMES: [Learning outcomes description]

TITLE: [Next Lesson Title]
OUTCOMES: [Next learning outcomes description]

UNIT: [Next Unit Name]
TITLE: [Practice Session Title]
OUTCOMES: [learning outcomes description]

Rules:
- Output UNIT: before the first lesson of each unit/section.
- If no unit header is found, use "UNIT: Default Unit" before the first lesson.
- Use the exact unit names as written in the content (without leading numbers like "Unit 1:").
- Continue for all lessons. Use the exact titles as written in the content.
- If a lesson has multiple learning outcomes (separated by newlines), combine ALL of them into a SINGLE line separated by semicolons (;).
- Keep all outcomes on one line after "OUTCOMES:".
- Remove any leading numbers or prefixes like "Lesson 8: " from the lesson title.
- If you see learning outcomes that are teacher-directed (like "follow the lesson plan" or "Introduce the topic at a high level"), remove them.
- If a lesson is missing learning outcomes, write them on your own (1 or 2 of them).

Practice sessions needed per chapter:
Chapter 1: 5 practice session(s)
Chapter 2: 6 practice session(s)
Chapter 3: 6 practice session(s)
Chapter 4: 6 practice session(s)

2. Focus on applying and reinforcing the concepts from that specific chapter's lessons
3. Include hands-on exercises, projects, or practical applications.
4. Have clear learning outcome of one sentence. After that, add a second sentence with "Output: [short description of the final result of the practice session, meaning what does the script/program will do]".
5. Each session should be a hands-on exercise or practical application of the concepts learned previously.
6. The theme could be one of those:
    a. Real life example: A practical exercise with a short story (theme) that adds context and real feeling to the exercise. Choose a theme from one of the following high-level domains: Productivity and personal tools; Media, content creation, or entertainment; Education, learning, or assessment systems; Health, wellness, or habit tracking; Finance, budgeting, or analytics; Games, simulations, or puzzles;  Communication, messaging, or collaboration; Data processing, transformation, or visualization; Scheduling, planning, or time management; Search, recommendation, or ranking systems; Security, access control, or validation; E-commerce platforms and marketplaces; Travel, navigation, or routing; Content organization, tagging, or knowledge management; Environmental, energy, or sustainability systems; Science, research, or data collection tools; Operations, logistics, or supply-chain systems; Creative tools (design, writing, music, video); Lifestyle, food, sports, and entertainment-related systems
       Note: The theme should support the learning goal and remain secondary to the technical task. If the theme is not clear, choose a theme from the list above.
    b. Classic programming exercise: A classic programming exercise or challenge, that you would find in traditional coding books, courses, or exercises.
8. Title should be short, without actions. For example, "Practice Session: Recipe app" and not "Practice Session: Building a Recipe App"
9. If the practice session is bigger than others, add two items with 'Part 1' and 'Part 2' to the title. For example, "Practice Lesson: To-Do list - Part 1" and "Practice Lesson: To-Do list - Part 2".
10. If the practice comes after theoretic lessons (where no coding is involved), create a practice session that is basically a quiz / thinking / matching / identifying exercise, not coding. In those cases, the title should be "Theory Practice Lesson: ".
