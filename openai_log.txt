[2025-12-24 23:30:39] LESSON PARSING (STREAMED)
------------------------------------------------------------
PROMPT:

Parse the following course content and extract lesson titles and learning outcomes.
Lesson names are followed by learning outcome for each lesson. All learning outcomes lines start with "--- ".

Return the result in this exact format:

TITLE: [Lesson Title]
OUTCOMES: [Learning outcomes description]

TITLE: [Next Lesson Title]
OUTCOMES: [Next learning outcomes description]

TITLE: [Practice Session Title]
OUTCOMES: [learning outcomes description]

Continue for all lessons. Use the exact titles as written in the content. 
If a lesson has multiple learning outcomes (separated by newlines), combine ALL of them into a SINGLE line separated by semicolons (;).
Keep all outcomes on one line after "OUTCOMES:".
If you see learning outcomes that are teacher-directed (like "follow the lesson plan" or "Introduce the topic at a high level"), remove them.
