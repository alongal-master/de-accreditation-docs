Week 1: Python Fundamentals

Introduction to Python Programming
Students will learn the basics of Python syntax, understand the Python interpreter, and write their first "Hello World" program. They will also explore Python's interactive mode and basic print statements.

Setting up Python Environment
Students will install Python on their system, set up a code editor (VS Code or PyCharm), and configure their development environment. They will learn about virtual environments and package management.

Variables and Data Types
Students will master variable declaration, understand Python's dynamic typing system, and work with different data types including integers, floats, strings, booleans, and None. They will learn type conversion and basic operations.

Basic Input and Output
Students will learn to use input() and print() functions effectively, understand string formatting with f-strings, and practice creating interactive programs that accept user input and display formatted output.

Arithmetic Operations
Students will perform mathematical calculations using Python operators, understand operator precedence, and work with built-in math functions. They will learn about integer division, modulo operations, and exponentiation.

String Manipulation
Students will master string methods, learn string slicing and indexing, understand string immutability, and practice common string operations like concatenation, formatting, and searching.

Control Structures - If Statements
Students will learn conditional logic using if, elif, and else statements. They will understand comparison operators, logical operators, and practice writing programs that make decisions based on different conditions.

Control Structures - Loops
Students will master for loops and while loops, learn about loop control statements (break, continue), understand iteration over different data structures, and practice writing efficient loop-based programs.

Week 2: Data Structures and Functions

Lists and List Operations
Students will create and manipulate lists, learn list methods (append, insert, remove, pop), understand list slicing and indexing, and practice common list operations like sorting and searching.

Dictionaries and Sets
Students will work with key-value pairs in dictionaries, learn dictionary methods and operations, understand set operations and their use cases, and practice data structure selection for different problems.

Functions - Definition and Usage
Students will define their own functions, understand function parameters and return values, learn about local and global scope, and practice writing reusable code with functions.

Function Parameters and Return Values
Students will master different types of function parameters (positional, keyword, default), understand return statements and multiple return values, and learn about function documentation and best practices.

Modules and Packages
Students will import and use built-in modules, create their own modules, understand the Python package system, and learn about the standard library and third-party packages.

File Handling - Reading Files
Students will open and read files in different modes, handle file exceptions, work with different file formats (text, CSV), and practice file processing techniques.

File Handling - Writing Files
Students will write data to files, append to existing files, work with different file formats, and learn about file encoding and best practices for file operations.

Error Handling and Exceptions
Students will use try-except blocks to handle errors, understand different types of exceptions, learn about exception hierarchy, and practice defensive programming techniques.

Week 3: Object-Oriented Programming and Advanced Topics

Object-Oriented Programming Basics
Students will understand the principles of OOP, learn about classes and objects, understand the concept of encapsulation, and practice creating simple classes with attributes and methods.

Classes and Objects
Students will define classes with constructors, create and use objects, understand instance variables and methods, and practice object-oriented design principles.

Inheritance and Polymorphism
Students will create class hierarchies using inheritance, understand method overriding and super(), learn about polymorphism and duck typing, and practice designing object-oriented solutions.

Working with Libraries
Students will install and use third-party libraries with pip, understand library documentation, work with popular libraries like requests and pandas, and learn about virtual environments for dependency management.

Data Analysis with Pandas
Students will work with DataFrames and Series, perform data manipulation and analysis, handle missing data, and practice basic data visualization techniques.

Data Visualization with Matplotlib
Students will create various types of plots and charts, customize visualizations, work with different plot types (line, bar, scatter, histogram), and learn about best practices for data visualization.

Web Scraping Introduction
Students will understand web scraping concepts, use libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests, handle different HTML elements, and practice ethical web scraping techniques.

Working with APIs
Students will make HTTP requests to APIs, handle JSON data, understand REST API concepts, and practice working with real-world APIs and web services.

Database Connections
Students will connect to databases using Python, perform CRUD operations, work with SQLite and other databases, and understand database design principles.

Week 4: Testing, Debugging, and Project Development

Testing Your Code
Students will write unit tests using unittest and pytest, understand test-driven development, learn about mocking and test fixtures, and practice writing comprehensive test suites.

Debugging Techniques
Students will use debugging tools and techniques, understand common debugging strategies, work with debuggers and logging, and learn about performance profiling.

Code Optimization
Students will identify performance bottlenecks, learn optimization techniques, understand algorithm complexity, and practice writing efficient Python code.

Project Planning and Structure
Students will plan and structure Python projects, understand project organization best practices, learn about version control with Git, and practice collaborative development workflows.

Final Project Development
Students will apply all learned concepts in a comprehensive project, work with real-world data, implement advanced features, and practice professional development practices.

Project Presentation
Students will present their final projects, demonstrate their Python skills, explain their code and design decisions, and practice technical communication and presentation skills.
