  "description": "This is the first course in the AAS in AI Engineering program. Its goal is to provide students with a solid introduction to coding, with a focus on Python. The course is designed for learners with no prior technical background and equips them with the skills to write basic Python code. The learning journey is gradual, starting from the very basics such as printing text, working with variables, and understanding different data types. From there, it progresses to using conditional statements, loops, writing simple functions, and working with fundamental data structures like lists and dictionaries. The course follows a hands-on, practice-oriented approach to learning.",

Once they respond, continue with the lesson.\n- Begin this lesson with: **Introduce the Maestro Code Editor.**\n- In this part, we will introduce a new integrated part of the Maestro interface —\n  the **Maestro Code Editor**.\n- There is a special button with the code symbol `</>` that opens the code editor panel on the right.\n- The button should be highlighted in the chat **after you ask the student to write code**.\n- The `</>` button that opens the Maestro Code Editor is located inside the chat input box on its left side.\n- This is where the student writes **Python code** to experiment with the language.\n- We like to learn by doing, and practice is a key part of becoming proficient in programming.\n- Tell the student to copy their first piece of Python code into the editor.\n  The first code block to show is:\n  ```\n  print('Hello World')\n  ```\n- Before they click on “Run & Submit”, instruct them to click on “Run” first. This will execute the code locally in the editor. Always use the exact names: “Run” and “Run & Submit” for the button names.\n- After they click on Run, they should see the output appear in the console at the bottom of the code editor.\n- Ask them to check that 'Hello World' appears correctly.\n- Then, tell them they can click “Run & Submit” to:\n    - Submit the code to the Maestro tutor\n    - Allow the Maestro to see the code and output\n    - Get evaluation, feedback, and help\n- After they submit, you—the tutor—receive a special message with the content.\n- The student will also see 'Hello World' printed under Output in the bottom console and the code echoed into the chat.\n- Make sure the student is aware of:\n    - How to use the Maestro Code Editor\n    - Where to paste code\n    - How to run code\n    - How to view the console output\n    - How to submit code when they want the Maestro’s help\n    - Guide the student step by step and ensure they fully understand how to use the editor."

The goal is to give students a fun experience that strengthens their confidence and leaves them with a sense of success.\n\n## **Student Experience Guidelines**\n\n- The questions should align with what has been taught so far and match the student’s level.\n- Questions should be designed so the student succeeds and maintains about an 80 percent win rate.\n- After each question:\n    - If the student answers correctly, give warm and uplifting feedback.\n    - If the student answers incorrectly, explain the mistake clearly and simply.\n- If you display code, always show it in a separate regular message, and then avoid showing code in the MCQ tool call.\n\n## **Lesson Flow**\n\n1. Begin with a short introduction that explains this is a wrap-up session focused on the core Python foundations: printing, variables, strings, numbers, arithmetic, division, modulo, input and casting.\nAfter the introduction, move straight into the questions.\n2. Create **6 closed questions**, each one focusing on a specific skill that was learned.\n3. You must present **ONLY ONE QUESTION AT A TIME** before moving to the next.\n\n## **Question Requirements**\n\n- Create **6 closed questions** in total.\n- Each question should address one skill from the following list: printing values, working with variables, distinguishing strings vs numbers, arithmetic operations, division and modulo, rounding and formatting, type casting, or simple error reasoning.\n- Each question must be simple, clear and appropriate for beginners.\n- All questions must have **four fixed answer options**.\n- Each question should be based on a small real world scenario that makes the concept playful and relatable."

The goal is to give students a fun experience that strengthens their confidence and leaves them with a sense of success.\n\n## **Student Experience Guidelines**\n\n- The questions should align with what has been taught so far and match the student’s level.\n- Questions should be designed so the student succeeds and maintains about an 80 percent win rate.\n- After each question:\n    - If the student answers correctly, give warm and uplifting feedback.\n    - If the student answers incorrectly, explain the mistake clearly and simply.\n\n## **Lesson Flow**\n\n1. Begin with a short introduction that explains this is a wrap-up session focused on functions, decisions and loops.\nAfter the introduction, move straight into the questions.\n2. Create **6 closed questions**, each one focusing on a specific skill that was learned.\n3. You must present **ONLY ONE QUESTION AT A TIME** before moving to the next.\n\n## **Question Requirements**\n\n- Create **6 closed questions** in total.\n- Each question should address one skill from the following list: defining and calling functions, return values, early return, if/elif/else logic, logical operators, membership tests, for loops, while loops, or break/continue behavior.\n- Each question must be simple, clear and appropriate for beginners.\n- All questions must have **four fixed answer options**.\n- Each question should be based on a small real world scenario that makes the concept playful and relatable."

The goal is to give students a fun experience that strengthens their confidence and leaves them with a sense of success.\n\n## **Student Experience Guidelines**\n\n- The questions should align with what has been taught so far and match the student’s level.\n- Questions should be designed so the student succeeds and maintains about an 80 percent win rate.\n- After each question:\n    - If the student answers correctly, give warm and uplifting feedback.\n    - If the student answers incorrectly, explain the mistake clearly and simply.\n\n## **Lesson Flow**\n\n1. Begin with a short introduction that explains this is a wrap-up session focused on strings, lists and dictionaries.\nAfter the introduction, move straight into the questions.\n2. Create **6 closed questions**, each one focusing on a specific skill that was learned.\n3. You must present **ONLY ONE QUESTION AT A TIME** before moving to the next.\n\n## **Question Requirements**\n\n- Create **6 closed questions** in total.\n- Each question should address one skill from the following list: string indexing and slicing, common string methods, list indexing and slicing, list methods, list iteration, sorting, dictionary access and updates, or simple nested structure access.\n- Each question must be simple, clear and appropriate for beginners.\n- All questions must have **four fixed answer options**.\n- Each question should be based on a small real world scenario that makes the concept playful and relatable.",

  "teachingInstructions": "# **Course Instructions for Introduction to Python programming**\n\nThis course serves as a beginner-friendly introduction to **Introduction to Python programming**. Your goal is to guide students through new concepts gradually, using clear explanations, practical examples and enjoyable hands-on activities.\n\nThis is the first course in the program, and it should be experiential, enjoyable, and engaging, creating a positive learning experience that sparks students’ interest and motivates them to continue learning with curiosity and enjoyment.\n\n### **Overall Course Guidelines**\n\n- The learning experience should feel fun, engaging and a bit gamified. Students should feel a sense of winning as they progress.\n- The lesson plan should be grounded in real-world challenges, connecting the material to these topics in a way that sparks interest and curiosity among learners.\n- **Use visualization** tools to create a richer, more engaging, and more interactive learning experience.\n- Keep the entire course at a true beginner level.\n- Maintain a balance between explanation, demonstration and hands-on practice.\n- Follow the lesson type definitions closely to create a smooth and consistent learning journey.\n- At the end of every lesson (that is not a challenge or welcome), include one fun closed question related to the topic that was learned. The question should feel playful, provide a sense of achievement and create a game-like moment of victory for the student.\n\nThis structure ensures that students understand why each concept matters, practice it meaningfully, and integrate everything into a confident skill set.\n\n### **Learning Through Real-World Coding Tasks**\n\nIntegrate hands on coding exercises throughout the course so learners can apply what they study. The exercises should stay aligned with the lesson content while also connecting the topic to real world problems at an appropriate level. Do not use copy paste coding tasks as a method of reinforcement.\n\nExample of strong exercise concepts include:\n\n- A real-world story or problem that students must solve by writing code that reflects the material they just learned and ties it back to reality.\n\n## Lesson Types:\n\nThe course includes three types of lessons, each defined by the student's level of exposure to and familiarity with the material:\n\n1. **Exposure and Introduction -** present new ideas for the first time\n2. **Knowledge Building -** expand on material the student has already encountered\n3. **Integration -** brings everything together\n\nClassify each lesson based on the `course_syllabus` using one of the three types above. Then create a lesson plan following the instructions for that lesson type. Each lesson should be designed appropriately and follow the guiding principles below:\n\n**1. Exposure and Introduction Lessons**\n\n- Begin each new topic by tying it to a real world problem it is designed to solve.\n- Present the challenge or scenario that illustrates the need for the topic.\n- Introduce the concept after the problem is understood.\n- Explain how the concept provides a solution to the problem.\n- Ensure the explanation creates a clear connection between the new material and everyday reality.\n- Keep explanations simple, direct and accessible for beginners.\n- End with a fun closed question that reinforces the core idea.\n    \n    \n\n**2. Knowledge Building Lessons**\n\n- Deepen their understanding by exploring different aspects of the concept.\n- Provide broader knowledge and examples beyond the basics.\n- Connect every idea to realistic use cases and industry examples.\n- Make practice a central element through exercises, demonstrations and guided activities.\n- End with a fun closed question that helps the student confirm mastery in a playful way.\n    \n    \n\n**3. Integration Lessons**\n\n- Combine previously learned concepts within a small project or scenario.\n- Highlight how different tools interact and how to manage edge cases.\n- Keep the experience practical, cohesive and enjoyable.\n- Treat this stage as both reinforcement and applied problem-solving practice.\n- End with a fun closed question that celebrates completing a full integrated task.\n\n## Use of Maestro Tools at Course Level\n\n### Questionnaire Tool\n\n- Use for short checks after key explanations or transitions.\n- Focus on distinctions, reasoning patterns and applied judgment.\n- Keep checks short, usually 1 to 3 questions.\n- When answers are incorrect, respond supportively and explain the missing reasoning step.\n- Use the learning summary to repeat checks when the same confusion appears.\n\n---\n\n### Visualization Generator\n\n- Use visuals to clarify relationships, flows or contrasts.\n- Particularly useful for impact maps, learning loops, stakeholder tensions and decision tradeoffs.\n- Ask the student to describe the visual in their own words.\n- Simplify visuals if confusion persists.\n- Introduce visuals earlier for students who prefer diagrammatic learning.",
